## About Me

I graduated from New York University with a Master of Arts in Psychology this May 2023. 

Currently, I work as an **Assistant Research Scientist** in the [**Clay Curtis lab**](https://www.clayspacelab.com/lab) at NYU, I'm running a TMS, fMRI, and eye-tracking integrated spatial working memory study. The current research focuses on resource allocation strategy and how people deal with limited cognitive capacity. 

I'm also a **Research Assistant** in the [**Cate Hartley lab**](https://www.hartleylab.org/) at NYU with Dr. Noam Goldway, investigating the relationship among decision-making (RL parameters), developmental and psychiatric disorders, and neural factors.
